hey.
you see the stores.ts file and how the formats are specified in interfaces in VDODatabase.
you see the first one (EmployeeRecord) imported from its module and all others hard coded there.
i want you to do the same for all as the first one.
they have the appropriate interfaces in there related module located in types/modules folder.
this will prevent from type mismatch.
you can either follow the first one pattern or do a better way you know is better.
